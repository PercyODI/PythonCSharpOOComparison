# C# Genesis and purpose

## What is C#

C# is a statically typed object-oriented language. It is designed to be a general purpose language that can be used in many different environments and paradigms.

## Goals of C#
The ECMA Standard of C# states several goals for the language designed
- Simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language
- Support for software engineering principles
  - Strong type checking
  - Array bounds checking
  - Detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables
  - Automatic garbage collection
- Suitable for deployment in distributed environments
- Source code portability
- Suitable for both hosted and embedded systems
- Economical memory and processing power requirements
  - Note: Not intended to compete with C or Assembly performances

## Relationship with Other languages

### C++ and C
C# was designed to take the best from C and from C++. C# uses a very similar syntax to that of C, which is very familiar to programmers. C++ was itself an object-oriented language, but had many quirks that C# aimed to fix. The name C# was inspired by the musical sharp notation that indicates a tone that is a half-step higher, similar to that of the ++ in C++.

### Java
It is obvious that C# took many ideas from Java. When C# was introduced, James Gosling (creator of Java) said that C# is "sort of Java with reliability, productivity, and security deleted." As the two languages have developed, they have gone different directions.
