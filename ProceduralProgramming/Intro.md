# Procedural Programming
>- Does the language support procedural programming?

Both languages support procedural programming. Python can be written lie a scripting language, and can be built using only functions and variables, no classes or objects in sight.

In C#, procedural code can be written, but it must be placed in some sort of Main class, and include some sort of Main method on the Main class. Aside from this, however, C# supports procedural programming.
