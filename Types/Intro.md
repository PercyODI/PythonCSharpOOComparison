## Type support
C# supports reference and value types.

Python exclusively supports reference types. When passing objects in Python, they are "Object references passed by value". This means that an object reference copied into a function. They function can modify the object (such as appending a list), but it cannot change the assignment of the object.

## New Value Types
C# makes a clear distinction between value types and reference types. The keyword `class` is used to define a new reference type, where the keyword `struct` is used to define a new value type.
