# Functional Programming
>- Does the language support functional programming?

Both languages support functional programming. Lambda expressions are available in both languages. Python provides built in functions `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` that work using lambda expression on lists.

C# provides true closures with more powerful lambdas than Python. In addition, LINQ provides many list comprehension methods that can be chained together in a fluent manner.
